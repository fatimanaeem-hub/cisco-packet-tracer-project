# 📡 Cisco Packet Tracer Network Design Project

This repository contains the complete configuration and documentation for a simulated computer network designed in **Cisco Packet Tracer** as part of my **Computer Networks coursework at FAST NUCES**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to design and configure a **scalable**, **secure**, and **efficient network** based on a given topology.  
The network incorporates a range of routing protocols, address planning techniques, server setups, and security implementations.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Applied

- **VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking)** for optimized IP address allocation  
- **Dynamic Routing Protocols:**
  - EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
  - OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
  - RIP v2 (Routing Information Protocol)
- **Route Redistribution** across multiple protocols

### 🖥️ Server Configuration

- **DHCP** – Dynamic IP assignment  
- **DNS** – Domain name resolution  
- **SMTP** – Email communication  
- **HTTP** – Web hosting  
- **FTP** – File sharing  

### 🔒 Security & Access Control

- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** for service-based restrictions  
- **NAT (Network Address Translation)** for internet access simulation

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**  
- Project documentation in PDF format (available in this repository)
